# Project Title

## 1. Research Question

What are you investigating, and why does it matter?

Do days with high discounts (i.e., "promotion days") result in significantly higher net sales? This matters because it provides a direct, data-driven answer to whether the store's promotion strategy is effectively increasing revenue or just cutting profit margins for no benefit.

## 2. Hypothesis

State your null and alternative hypotheses clearly and succinctly.

Null Hypothesis: The true mean net sales on "Promo Days" is the same as or less than the mean Net sales on "Regular Days."
Alternative Hypothesis: The true mean Net sales on "Promo Days" is greater than the mean Net sales on "Regular Days."


## 3. Data Description

Describe your data source(s):

* Where it comes from (URL, API, dataset name)
* What each observation represents (unit of analysis)
* Number of observations and key variables
* Any filtering, cleaning, or transformation steps

## 4. Methods

Summarize how you analyzed the data:

* The test statistic for your permutation test
* How you simulated or resampled under the null hypothesis
* The metric(s) for which you created bootstrap confidence intervals
* Why the CLT does not apply to at least one metric

## 5. Results

Present your main findings:

* Key summary statistics and visualizations
* Observed test statistic and p-value (if applicable)
* Bootstrap confidence intervals for relevant metrics

## 6. Uncertainty Estimation

Discuss your resampling results:

* How many resamples you used
* What the bootstrap or randomization distributions looked like
* How you interpret the interval estimates

## 7. Limitations

Briefly note any limitations in data, assumptions, or methods, including sources of bias or missing data.

## 8. References




List all datasets, tools, libraries, or papers you cited.
